# Creative Meta-Prompt: The Systematic Orchestra

## 1. Core Creative Metaphor
Your design must embody the grounded metaphor of **"The Systematic Orchestra"**.
This concept is derived from the research keyword **"Systematic"**. It visualizes the Bigger Boss platform as a master conductor, flawlessly orchestrating 97 specialist "agents" (the musicians) to perform a complex strategic "score" with precision, speed, and harmony.

* **Visuals:** Use clean, rhythmic, grid-based layouts. White space is the "pause" between notes, creating a sense of controlled, sophisticated pacing. Data visualizations should be elegant, like light trails from a conductor's baton, not sterile bar charts.
* **Tone:** Confident, precise, expert, and harmonious. Every element feels intentional, part of a larger, high-quality composition.

## 2. Core User Problem to Solve
This design must solve this specific `Selected_Pain_Point` from the research: **"Compliance Violations Risk (CRITICAL)"**. The user (Professional Paul persona) is anxious about legal review bottlenecks and the reputational/financial risk of non-compliant claims.

## 3. Core Value Prop to Showcase
Every design choice must hero this `Selected_Differentiator`: **"The 4-Persona Systematic Review (85+ Score Guarantee)"**. This is not just a feature; it is the *proof* of quality. It must be visualized and explained with absolute clarity.

## 4. The Creative Puzzle (Constraint-as-Creativity)
You face a specific creative puzzle based on the `Selected_Constraint`: **"The brand is new and has 'no case studies yet'"**.

* **Your challenge:** How do you build 100% unshakeable trust *without* using any client logos or past-performance case studies? Your design must make the **process** (the 4-persona review) and the **guarantee** (the 85+ score) so transparent and robust that the methodology itself becomes the social proof.

## 6. Required Section Ideas
Based on this, generate a unique layout for the following sections:
1.  **Hero Section:** Must visualize "The Systematic Orchestra" metaphor. Show a sense of controlled, complex orchestration delivering immediate clarity and confidence.
2.  **Problem Section:** Must directly address the "Compliance Violations Risk." Use visuals that evoke anxiety (like redacted text, warning symbols) and contrast them with the solution.
3.  **Solution (Features) Section:** Must showcase the "4-Persona Systematic Review." Use a 4-part visual layout to introduce each "expert" persona (SEO, UX, Conversion, Quality) and their role in the "orchestra."
4.  **Trust/Proof Section:** Must solve the "Creative Puzzle." Instead of a "client logo" grid, create a "Process Transparency" grid. Visually break down the 85+ score guarantee and the AHPRA/ASIC compliance checks. Make the *system* the hero.
5.  **CTA Section:** Must be a clear, single action that reinforces confidence, e.g., "Book Your Compliance & Quality Audit."
