# First Test Blog Post

This blog post demonstrates the content editing workflow using Sveltia CMS.

## What We're Testing

- Markdown editing interface
- Image uploads
- Metadata fields (title, description, author, tags)
- Publish date handling
- Git commit workflow

## Expected Workflow

1. User accesses `/admin` interface
2. Navigates to Blog Posts collection
3. Clicks "New Blog Post"
4. Fills in title, description, content
5. Uploads featured image (optional)
6. Saves changes
7. CMS creates Git commit
8. Changes reflected on site after build

This validates the complete content management lifecycle.
