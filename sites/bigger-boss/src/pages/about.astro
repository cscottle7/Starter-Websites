      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        DWS-Web-AI was born from a simple observation: modern web agencies struggle to scale quality website delivery
        without growing their teams proportionally. Traditional CMS platforms are expensive, client editing workflows
        are cumbersome, and manual quality assurance consumes valuable developer time.
      </p>

      <p>
        We built DWS-Web-AI to solve these challenges through three core innovations:
      </p>

      <h3>1. AI-First Architecture</h3>
      <p>
        Every site we build is optimized from the ground up for AI crawler indexing. With AI search engines like
        ChatGPT and Claude becoming primary discovery mechanisms, we ensure your content is technically accessible
        through server-side rendering, semantic HTML, and comprehensive schema markup.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Automated Quality Gates</h3>
      <p>
        Our 6-gate quality validation system automates 70% of manual audit work. Every deployment must pass SEO compliance,
        accessibility standards, performance benchmarks, AI readiness checks, and security audits before reaching production.
      </p>

      <h3>3. True Client Independence</h3>
      <p>
        We empower non-technical clients to manage their own content through Sveltia CMS - a modern, Git-based visual editor
        that requires zero licensing costs. Clients edit content, upload images, and publish changes without developer assistance,
        achieving 90% self-service for routine updates.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Technology Stack</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Astro 5.0:</strong> Islands architecture for optimal performance (zero JavaScript by default)</li>
        <li><strong>Sveltia CMS:</strong> Free, Git-based visual content editing</li>
        <li><strong>Nx Monorepo:</strong> Scalable infrastructure supporting 10+ client sites with shared component libraries</li>
        <li><strong>GitHub Actions:</strong> Automated CI/CD with quality gate enforcement</li>
        <li><strong>Claude Code Agents:</strong> AI-powered automation for SEO, accessibility, and content optimization</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
      <p>
        We're committed to maintaining this platform as open-source foundation for modern web development. Every component,
        utility, and agent definition is version-controlled, documented, and designed for reusability across client projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Core Web Vitals "Good" scores:</strong> Every site we launch meets Google's performance thresholds<br>
        <strong>WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:</strong> Accessibility is non-negotiable<br>
        <strong>100% Schema Markup Coverage:</strong> Machine-readable structured data on every key page<br>
        <strong>Zero CMS Licensing Costs:</strong> Sustainable economics for small agencies
