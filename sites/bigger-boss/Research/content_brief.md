  #### Section 6: FAQs

  **H2:** "Frequently Asked Questions"  
  **Q: How can you deliver in 90 minutes what takes agencies 8-12 weeks?**  
  A: We use 97 specialist AI agents executing research in parallel, not sequential human workflows. Traditional agencies have bottlenecks: waiting for team members to be available, manual research taking days, multiple revision cycles with approval delays. Our system eliminates these bottlenecks through parallel execution (all research phases happen simultaneously) and systematic quality assurance (no subjective back-and-forth revisions). The AI doesn't need meetings, emails, or coordination overhead—it executes research continuously until completion.  
  **Q: Is the quality really as good as human strategists?**  
  A: Our 4-persona quality review system ensures every deliverable scores 85/100+ across SEO, conversion, UX, and content quality dimensions. Our average final score is 87-91/100. Many clients report our strategies match or exceed traditional agency quality because we apply systematic evaluation frameworks that many agencies lack. Traditional agency quality varies by team member experience; our quality is consistent because the same systematic process evaluates every deliverable.  
  **Q: How do you ensure compliance for professional services?**  
  A: We have built-in compliance frameworks for AHPRA (healthcare), ASIC (financial services), and Law Society (legal services) regulations. Automated compliance checking identifies prohibited content (guarantees, misleading claims, missing disclaimers), followed by human expert review for professional services deliverables. We maintain a 100% compliance record with zero violations to date across all professional services projects.  
  **Q: What if I'm not satisfied with the deliverables?**  
  A: 30-day satisfaction guarantee on all packages. If you're not satisfied with deliverables, we'll revise based on your feedback or provide a full refund within 30 days. No questions asked. Comprehensive and Enterprise tiers include an 85+ quality score guarantee—if any deliverable scores below 85, we'll automatically revise until the quality threshold is met.  
  **Q: Can I see sample deliverables before purchasing?**  
  A: Yes. During the discovery call, we demonstrate relevant capabilities and show sample deliverables from similar industries (with client information redacted). We can also provide redacted sample reports demonstrating research depth, analysis quality, and deliverable format. Book a discovery call to request samples.  
  **Q: Do you offer white-label services for agencies?**  
  A: Yes. Enterprise tier includes white-label resale rights. You can deliver our strategies to your clients under your agency branding. We provide unbranded deliverables (no Bigger Boss references) for easy customisation with your agency logo, colours, and branding. Many agencies use this to scale client delivery without hiring additional strategists.  
  **Q: How involved do I need to be during the 90-minute process?**  
  A: Minimal involvement required. After the discovery call and brief submission (30 minutes total of your time), we execute the research independently. You'll receive deliverables 90-180 minutes later (depending on package tier). Then you participate in the strategy review call (1-2 hours depending on tier) to review findings and discuss implementation. Total time investment: 2-3 hours spread over 2-7 days.  
  **Q: What happens after I receive deliverables?**  
  A: You receive complete implementation guides with every deliverable, explaining how to execute recommendations. Strategy review call included (tier dependent: 1 hour for Comprehensive, 2 hours for Enterprise) to discuss findings and answer questions. Ongoing support available via email (response times vary by tier: 48 hours for Essential, 24 hours for Comprehensive/Enterprise). Optional add-ons: implementation consulting ($297/hour), team training ($997/session), quarterly strategy refreshes ($1,997/quarter).

  #### Section 6: Pricing FAQs

  **Q: Why are you so much cheaper than agencies?**  
  A: We eliminate the biggest agency costs: headcount (no salaries, benefits, training), office overhead (fully remote operation), and time inefficiencies (no meetings, emails, coordination delays). Our AI orchestration system delivers in 90 minutes what takes agencies 8-12 weeks with 5-10 team members involved. We pass those cost savings directly to you through transparent flat pricing.  
  **Q: Do you offer payment plans?**  
  A: Enterprise tier offers 3 monthly instalments with no interest (e.g., $8,997 divided into 3 payments of $2,999). Essential and Comprehensive tiers require full payment upfront. Annual agreements offer custom payment terms—contact us to discuss options.  
  **Q: Are there any hidden fees?**  
  A: No. The package price includes everything listed in the inclusions. Add-ons are optional and clearly priced separately (e.g., technical SEO audit $1,497, implementation support $297/hour). No setup fees, no subscription fees, no ongoing costs unless you choose optional quarterly refresh or support plans.  
  **Q: Can I upgrade my package after starting?**  
  A: Yes. Pay the difference between packages within 30 days of original purchase. Example: Essential ($2,997) upgraded to Comprehensive ($4,997) \= $2,000 upgrade fee. We'll incorporate additional deliverables (comprehensive keyword research, 12-month calendar, 4-persona quality review, compliance integration) into your existing project.  
  **Q: Do you offer discounts for agencies or volume purchases?**  
  A: Yes. Volume discounts range from 10-30% based on annual project volume (see Volume Discounts section above). Custom pricing available for 50+ projects annually. White-label agency partnerships receive wholesale pricing—contact us for detailed pricing structure.  
  **Q: What's included in the "Quarterly Refresh" for Enterprise tier?**  
  A: Every 3 months, we update your strategy deliverables: refresh keyword research with new opportunities, update competitor analysis with recent changes, revise content calendar with current trends, add new trending topics and market shifts. Keeps your strategy current without manual research work. Value: $1,997 per refresh if purchased separately.  
  **Q: Is there a trial or money-back guarantee?**  
  A: 30-day satisfaction guarantee serves as our "trial"—review deliverables for 30 days, request revision or full refund if not satisfied. We don't offer free trials because complete delivery happens in 90 minutes (no ongoing trial period needed). You can see sample deliverables during discovery call before purchasing.  
  **Q: How do I know the Comprehensive package is worth $2,000 more than Essential?**  
  A: Comprehensive includes:  
- 100+ keywords vs 20-30 (4x keyword research)  
- 12-month content calendar vs 3 blog ideas (12 months vs 3 pieces)  
- 4-persona quality review vs editorial review (systematic quality assurance)  
- Compliance integration (saves $500-$1,500 per article legal review)  
- Strategy consultation call (1 hour expert guidance)  
- 85+ score guarantee (quality assurance)  
- 24-hour support vs 48-hour
