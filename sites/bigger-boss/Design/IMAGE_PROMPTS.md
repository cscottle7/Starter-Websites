### AI Generation Tips

**For Midjourney:**

- Use `--ar` for aspect ratios (1:1, 4:3, 16:9, 3:4)
- Add `--quality 2` for higher detail (costs more credits)

**For DALL-E 3:**
- More descriptive prompts work better
- Specify "realistic photography" vs "illustration" clearly
- Include lighting details (natural, studio, soft, dramatic)
- Mention specific art styles (corporate photography, Dribbble illustration, flat design)

**For Stable Diffusion:**
- Use detailed technical specifications
- Include negative prompts to avoid unwanted elements
- Specify style references (Unsplash, Behance, corporate)
- Use LoRA models for consistency if available
