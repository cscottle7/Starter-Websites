### Best Suited For

- Buyers concerned about AI quality
- Professional services requiring compliance confidence
- Agencies seeking systematic, proven methodology

### Conversion Strategy
- Multiple email capture opportunities (hero, beta section, footer)
- Dual CTA approach (primary + secondary) reduces friction
- Representative testimonials build trust without fake reviews
- FAQ section proactively addresses objections
- Sample deliverable download creates engagement pre-conversion
- Beta program scarcity (20 spots) creates urgency

## Recommended Approach: Hybrid Strategy

**Primary Foundation:** Concept 3 (Human + AI Collaboration)

**Why:**
- Broadest persona appeal (works for all 3 audiences)
- Addresses #1 objection ("Will AI be good enough?") through systematic human review
- Balances credibility (process transparency) with aspiration (representative results)
- Ready to evolve with real testimonials post-beta

**Strategic Additions from Concept 1:**
- Comparison table (Bigger Boss vs Alternatives) → Insert after Hero section
- ROI calculator (interactive savings) → Insert in Audience Segmentation section
- Sample deliverable tabs (deeper preview) → Replace simple preview in Concept 3

**Strategic Additions from Concept 2:**
- Minimalist FAQ design (single column, generous spacing) → Cleaner presentation
- Sticky email footer (appears after 50% scroll) → Additional conversion point
- Simplified beta form (inline single row on desktop) → Reduced friction

**Result:**
- Concept 3's human-centered foundation (trust-building)
- Concept 1's analytical proof (data-driven decision-makers)
- Concept 2's sophisticated simplicity (premium positioning)
