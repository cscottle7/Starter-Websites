## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long does implementation take?**
A: Foundation Package (2 weeks), Complete Platform (4-6 weeks), Enterprise (8-12 weeks). We work iteratively with approval gates at each phase.

**Q: Do we own the code?**
A: Absolutely. Complete source code ownership with no ongoing licensing fees for the platform itself (Sveltia CMS is free and open-source).

**Q: What if we need help after implementation?**
A: All packages include 30 days post-launch support. We also offer ongoing portfolio management packages for continuous optimization.

**Q: Can this integrate with our existing workflow?**
A: Yes. The platform is designed to complement your existing tools. We can integrate with your CI/CD, project management, and client communication systems.

**Q: What if Sveltia CMS doesn't work for us?**
A: The architecture is CMS-agnostic. We can migrate to CloudCannon ($49/month) or TinaCMS if needed—all content is stored in Git, not tied to any specific CMS.
