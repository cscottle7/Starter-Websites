metaphor_definition: |
  Harbourview General Practice is THE WELLNESS CATALYST—the transformative agent that activates your health journey.

  Like a chemical catalyst that lowers activation energy and accelerates reactions, we remove barriers to care and empower patients to drive their own health transformations. We don't just provide healthcare—we enable breakthroughs.

  Every patient interaction is a catalyst reaction: bringing together expert guidance (the catalyst), patient agency (the reactant), and community support (the reaction environment) to create lasting wellness outcomes.

      anti_ai: "Diagonal clip-path (NOT rectangular sections)"

anti_ai_constraints:

  - type: "creative_hierarchy_inversion"
    implementation: "Patient stats LARGER than section headings"
    example: |
      <h2 class="text-2xl text-stone-600">Mental Health Support</h2>
      <p class="text-7xl font-bold text-violet-500">350+</p>
      <p class="text-xl text-stone-700">patients empowered to access psychology services</p>
    rationale: "AI defaults to H2 > stats. Inverting this creates unexpected visual impact."
    research_source: "ENHANCED_VISUAL_ANALYSIS.md - Creative hierarchy inversions"

  - type: "overlapping_sections"
    implementation: "Negative margin overlaps between sections"
    example: |
      <section class="py-32 bg-violet-500">...</section>
      <section class="py-20 -mt-20 relative z-10">
        <!-- Overlaps previous section by 5rem -->
      </section>
    rationale: "AI generates sequential sections with gaps. Overlaps break this pattern."
    research_source: "Magazine editorial layout strategy"

  - type: "diagonal_section_breaks"
    implementation: "clip-path polygons for diagonal edges"
    example: |
      <section class="relative" style="clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 90%, 0 100%)">
        <!-- Diagonal bottom edge -->
      </section>
    rationale: "AI uses rectangular sections. Diagonal breaks add organic dynamism."
    research_source: "Bold/Vibrant cluster - dynamic asymmetry"

  - type: "multi_color_gradients"
    implementation: "3+ color gradient transitions"
    example: "bg-gradient-to-r from-violet-500 via-red-400 to-amber-300"
    rationale: "AI uses 2-color gradients. 3+ colors create unique brand signature."
    research_source: "Energetic gradient requirement - Cluster 3"

  - type: "high_contrast_accessibility"
    implementation: "WCAG AAA contrast ratios (7:1+)"
    example: "Violet-500 (#8B5CF6) on white = 7.5:1 contrast"
    rationale: "Vibrant colors MUST maintain accessibility. Forces careful palette selection."
