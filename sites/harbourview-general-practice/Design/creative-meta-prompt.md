# Creative Meta-Prompt: Harbourview General Practice Homepage
## Research-Grounded Design Brief

**Client:** Harbourview General Practice
**Project:** Homepage Design
**Generated:** 18 November 2025
**Grounding Rate:** 100% (14/14 elements traced to research)
**Creative Framework:** "The Safe Harbour" Metaphor

---

## SECTION 1: Core Creative Metaphor

### The Safe Harbour

Harbourview General Practice is **a safe harbour in the healthcare journey**—a calm, sheltered space where patients find refuge from the complexity and stress of managing their health.

Like a well-designed marina offering multiple entry points, multilingual harbour services, and experienced harbour masters, we provide accessible, expert care that makes every patient feel securely moored and understood.

#### Metaphor Visual Expression

**What it looks like:**
- **Calm waters, not choppy chaos:** Generous spacing (py-16 md:py-24), breathing room, unhurried rhythm
- **Experienced harbour master, not novice:** Bold typography, confident hierarchy, 80 years expertise
- **Multiple entry points, not barriers:** Clear CTAs, accessible navigation, online booking 24/7
- **International port, not exclusive:** Multicultural imagery, 4 languages spoken, inclusive visuals
- **Tidal rhythm, not mechanical grid:** Varied spacing (py-12/py-16/py-20/py-24), asymmetric layouts

**What it avoids:**
- ❌ Clinical sterility (cold hospital aesthetic)
- ❌ Stock medical imagery (generic doctor photos)
- ❌ Uniform AI grids (perfectly symmetric layouts)
- ❌ Harsh angles (sharp rectangles)
- ❌ Rushed, cramped layouts

**What it embraces:**
- ✅ Coastal warmth (harbour blues, sunrise teal)
- ✅ Authentic photography (real practice, natural light)
- ✅ Organic rhythm (tidal variation)
- ✅ Smooth curves (rounded-2xl, rounded-full)
- ✅ Spacious, calm layouts

#### Metaphor Grounding

**100% Keyword Alignment:**
1. **Patient-centred** = Sheltered harbour space (protected, safe)
2. **Experienced** = Seasoned harbour master (80 years combined)
3. **Accessible** = Multiple entry points (online booking, bulk billing, multilingual)
4. **Community** = Marina community (interconnected, local hub)
5. **Compassionate** = Calm gentle waters (not rushed, listening)
6. **Modern** = Contemporary marina facilities (digital-first)
7. **Multilingual** = International port flags (Mandarin, Hindi, Spanish, Punjabi)

## SECTION 2: Core User Problem

### The Frustrated Healthcare Seeker

**Primary Pain Point:**
> "I can't get an appointment when I need one, and when I finally do, the doctor is rushed and I feel like I'm on a conveyor belt. I don't feel listened to."

**Persona Evidence:**
- **Emma (anxiety patient):** "Frustration when favourite GP is fully booked for 2+ weeks...impatient if doctor running >15 minutes late" (audience_personas.md, line 155-158)
- **Martinez Family (new parents):** "High anxiety when baby unwell, needs rapid appointment availability" (audience_personas.md, line 256)
- **Robert (diabetic patient):** "Motivation for lifestyle changes...struggles...sometimes forgets" - needs continuity and patience (audience_personas.md, line 358-359)

**Emotional State:**
- Anxious (health concerns unresolved)
- Frustrated (access barriers)
- Unheard (rushed consultations)
- Overwhelmed (complexity of booking systems)

**Barrier Specifics:**
1. **Access:** Long wait times (2-3 weeks for routine appointments at competitors)
2. **Time:** Phone-only booking during work hours (can't call 9-5)
3. **Language:** No multilingual GPs (22% CALD population underserved)
4. **Cost:** Unexpected fees, unclear bulk billing policies
5. **Quality:** Rushed 5-minute consultations (patient review complaint)

## SECTION 4: Creative Puzzle (Constraint Reframed)

### The AHPRA Compliance Challenge

**Constraint:**
> Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) prohibits claiming guaranteed health outcomes or "cures". All medical claims must be evidence-based and avoid false/misleading representations.

**The Challenge:**
How do we communicate expertise, success, and positive patient experiences WITHOUT making prohibited outcome claims?

**Creative Solution: Journey Language (Harbour Metaphor)**

Instead of outcome claims ("We will cure you"), use **journey and support language** that naturally flows from the Safe Harbour metaphor:

**Prohibited Language:**
- ❌ "We will cure your condition"
- ❌ "Guaranteed health results"
- ❌ "Fix your health problems"
- ❌ "Eliminate your symptoms"

**Compliant Alternative (Harbour-Aligned):**
- ✅ "**Supported** through your health journey" (harbour provides support, not guarantees)
- ✅ "**Guided** by experienced GPs" (harbour master guides vessels)
- ✅ "**Sheltered space** to discuss your concerns" (harbour offers shelter)
- ✅ "**Navigate** complex health decisions together" (harbour navigation)
- ✅ "**Moored** in continuity of care" (secure mooring in safe harbour)

**Quantifiable Evidence (Allowed):**
- ✅ "Dr. Sharma has helped **over 350 patients** access Medicare-funded psychology services"
- ✅ "Dr. Mitchell has supported **more than 200 patients** in achieving cholesterol improvements"
- ✅ "Dr. Chen has **guided over 500 families** through childhood immunisation programmes"

**Testimonial Framing:**
- ✅ "Individual patient experiences" (honest, specific, attributed)
- ❌ "Typical results" or "guaranteed outcomes"

**Source:** homepage_final_content.md, line 709 + AHPRA guidelines

**Creative Benefit:**
The harbour metaphor NATURALLY supports compliant language—harbours provide shelter, guidance, and support, not outcome guarantees. This constraint becomes a creative strength.

## SECTION 5: Mood Board & Visual References

### Coastal Healthcare Aesthetic

**Visual Direction:**
Warm, approachable coastal healthcare—combining medical professionalism with Northern Beaches coastal calm.

#### Color Palette Mood

**Primary: Deep Harbour Blue (#1B75BB)**
- Medical trust and professionalism
- Deep water stability
- Reference: Ocean depths, calm harbour water

**Accent: Coastal Teal (#4DB8B8)**
- Approachability and healing
- Shallow coastal waters
- Reference: Turquoise shallows, sunrise reflection

**Neutral: Weathered Timber (Slate 100-700)**
- Experience and authenticity
- Natural coastal materials
- Reference: Weathered dock posts, coastal boardwalks

**Warm Accent: Sunrise Glow (Amber 100, Rose 50)**
- Compassion and hope
- Morning harbour light
- Reference: Golden hour coastal photography

#### Imagery References

**Hero Imagery:**
- Soft morning light on calm harbour water
- High horizon line (spacious sky)
- Minimal people (focus on peaceful environment)
- Natural coastal landscapes (NOT stock medical)

**Inspiration Sources:**
1. **Coastal Photography:** Northern Beaches Sydney sunrise/sunset galleries
2. **Modern Healthcare Design:** Primary Health Tasmania (warm, accessible)
3. **Asymmetric Layouts:** Awwwards "Healthcare 2024" category (organic grids)

**Doctor Photography:**
- Natural window light (not harsh studio)
- Soft neutral backgrounds (light blue-grey)
- Warm genuine smiles (not forced stock grins)
- Professional casual attire (scrubs or white coat over business casual)

**Component Styling:**
- Smooth curves: `rounded-2xl` cards, `rounded-full` buttons
- Gentle shadows: `shadow-lg` (floating on water)
- Soft borders: `border-2` (not thin harsh lines)

#### Typography Inspiration

**Headings:** Bold and Anchored
- Reference: Harbour beacons, marina signage
- Implementation: `text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold`

**Body:** Flowing and Readable
- Reference: Gentle wave rhythm
- Implementation: `text-lg leading-relaxed`

#### Anti-AI Design Examples

**Intentional Asymmetry:**
- Hero: 5-column grid, 3:2 text-image split (NOT 50/50)
- Services: Offset card grid (NOT uniform heights)

**Unexpected Hierarchy:**
- Large testimonial pull quotes (`text-3xl`)
- Bigger than their section headings (`text-2xl`)
- Breaks predictable rhythm (like tidal surge)

**Spatial Variation:**
- Alternating section padding: py-12, py-16, py-20, py-24
- Mimics tidal rhythm (high tide/low tide)
- NOT uniform py-16 throughout

**External Mood Board URLs:**
(To be populated with Dribbble/Awwwards research)
- [Coastal medical practice examples]
- [Asymmetric healthcare layouts]
- [Natural light doctor photography]

## SECTION 7: Anti-AI Design Checklist (Quality Gates)

### Checkpoint 1: Spatial Rhythm (Tidal Variation)

**Requirement:** Section padding must vary (NOT uniform py-16 throughout)

**Implementation:**
```html
<section class="py-12 md:py-16">   <!-- Low tide -->
<section class="py-16 md:py-24">   <!-- High tide -->
<section class="py-12 md:py-16">   <!-- Low tide -->
<section class="py-20 md:py-32">   <!-- High tide -->
```

**Verification:**
- Inspect computed padding values
- Should see at least 3 different padding values used
- NO uniform py-16 on all sections

**Pass Criteria:** ✅ 3+ distinct padding values
**Fail Criteria:** ❌ All sections use same padding

---

### Checkpoint 2: Intentional Asymmetry

**Requirement:** Hero section NOT centered 50/50 split

**Implementation:**
```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-5 gap-12">
  <div class="lg:col-span-3">Text content</div>
  <div class="lg:col-span-2">Image</div>
</div>
```

**Verification:**
- Hero layout is 5-column grid (3:2 ratio)
- NOT `grid-cols-2` (50/50 split)

**Pass Criteria:** ✅ Asymmetric layout (3:2 or similar)
**Fail Criteria:** ❌ Symmetric centered layout

---

### Checkpoint 3: Unexpected Hierarchy

**Requirement:** Testimonial quotes LARGER than their section heading

**Implementation:**
```html
<h2 class="text-2xl">What Our Patients Say</h2>
<!-- Testimonial quote below -->
<blockquote class="text-3xl">Patient testimonial text...</blockquote>
```

**Verification:**
- Section heading: `text-2xl` (24px)
- Testimonial quotes: `text-3xl` (30px)
- Quotes are visually larger

**Pass Criteria:** ✅ Quotes larger than heading
**Fail Criteria:** ❌ Quotes smaller or equal to heading

---

### Checkpoint 4: Color Nuance (Water Depth Palette)

**Requirement:** Use 5+ distinct blue/teal tones (not flat 2-color palette)

**Implementation:**
- Primary: #1B75BB (harbour deep)
- Teal: #4DB8B8 (coastal shallow)
- Slate 50, 100, 200, 600, 700 (neutral blues)
- Gradients (harbour sunrise)

**Verification:**
- Count distinct color values in CSS
- Should see 7+ blue/grey tones

**Pass Criteria:** ✅ 5+ blue tones
**Fail Criteria:** ❌ Only 1-2 blue colors used

---

### Checkpoint 5: Organic Card Heights

**Requirement:** Service/feature cards NOT uniform heights

**Implementation:**
```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-8 items-start">
  <!-- NOT items-stretch or items-center -->
</div>
```

**Verification:**
- Grid uses `items-start` (cards align to top, organic heights)
- NOT `items-stretch` (forced equal heights)

**Pass Criteria:** ✅ Cards have varied heights
**Fail Criteria:** ❌ All cards forced to same height

---

### Checkpoint 6: AHPRA Compliance Language

**Requirement:** NO guaranteed outcome claims

**Prohibited:**
- ❌ "We will cure"
- ❌ "Guaranteed results"
- ❌ "Fix your problems"

**Compliant:**
- ✅ "Supported through journey"
- ✅ "Guided by experienced GPs"
- ✅ "Helped X patients access..."

**Verification:**
- Search content for prohibited phrases
- All doctor stats use "helped/supported/guided" language

**Pass Criteria:** ✅ Zero prohibited claims
**Fail Criteria:** ❌ Any guaranteed outcome language

---
