## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need a referral to see Dr Nguyen?

Yes, a referral from your GP is required to access Medicare rebates. This also ensures Dr Nguyen has your relevant medical history to provide the most effective consultation.

### How long are the current wait times?

For routine appointments, the wait is typically 2-4 weeks. We can often see urgent cases within one week, with emergency consultations available on the same day when clinically appropriate.

### Will surgery always be necessary?

No. Dr Nguyen always explores medical management first. In our experience, approximately 90% of conditions can be managed non-surgically. Surgery is recommended only when conservative treatments are not effective or when it offers the best long-term outcome. There are some conditions that involve surgery up front and Dr Nguyen will discuss this with you.
