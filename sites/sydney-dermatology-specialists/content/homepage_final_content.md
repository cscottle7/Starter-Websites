## Section 1: Welcome & Credentials

**H2:** Welcome to Sydney Dermatology Specialists

At Sydney Dermatology Specialists, we provide expert care for all dermatology needs—from skin cancer diagnosis and treatment to complex medical dermatology and evidence-based cosmetic treatments.

Our specialist dermatologists, **Dr Alexandra Harper (FACD)** and **Dr Michael Nguyen (FACD)**, are Fellows of the Australasian College of Dermatologists with extensive training and experience in medical, surgical, and cosmetic dermatology. With over 24 years of combined specialist experience, our team delivers the highest standard of comprehensive skin care.

### Why Choose a Specialist Dermatologist?

Dermatologists complete 12+ years of medical training, including four years of specialist dermatology training beyond general medical qualifications. This rigorous expertise ensures accurate diagnosis, evidence-based treatment, and optimal outcomes for even the most complex skin conditions.

Unlike general practitioners or cosmetic nurses, specialist dermatologists hold Fellowship of the Australasian College of Dermatologists (FACD)—Australia's peak specialist dermatology qualification. This advanced training enables us to diagnose and treat over 3,000 skin, hair, and nail conditions, from common concerns to rare and complex diseases.

### Our Approach

As specialist dermatologists, we take time to understand your concerns, explain your diagnosis clearly, and collaborate with you to develop a personalised treatment plan. Whether you're referred by your GP for a skin cancer assessment, seeking help for persistent acne or psoriasis, or exploring cosmetic treatments, you'll receive expert care. Our modern, welcoming clinics deliver the highest standard of specialist dermatology services.

## Section 3: Mohs Surgery Excellence (Differentiator Feature)

**H2:** Dr Harper's Mohs Surgery Expertise: The Gold Standard for Facial Skin Cancer

**Featured Section with Background:** [Reference: Supporting Image 1 - Abstract Medical Pattern]

Dr Alexandra Harper is one of only **six Mohs surgeons in Sydney** (as of 2025, based on Australasian College of Dermatologists fellowship records), providing rare subspecialist expertise in this advanced skin cancer treatment technique.

### What is Mohs Surgery?

Mohs micrographic surgery is a tissue-sparing surgical technique that removes skin cancer layer by layer while examining each layer under a microscope in real-time. This precision approach ensures complete cancer removal while preserving maximum healthy tissue—critical for cosmetically sensitive areas like the face, ears, nose, and eyelids.

### Why Mohs Surgery?

**Highest Cure Rate:** 98-99% cure rate for primary basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in published medical studies—significantly higher than standard excision

**Tissue-Sparing:** Minimal healthy tissue removed, resulting in smaller surgical sites and superior cosmetic outcomes

**Same-Day Results:** On-site pathology laboratory provides immediate microscopic analysis during surgery

**Facial Preservation:** Ideal for skin cancers on the face where cosmetic outcome and tissue preservation are paramount

### When is Mohs Surgery Recommended?

- Skin cancers on the face, ears, nose, eyelids, lips, or hands
- Large or aggressive tumours
- Recurrent skin cancers (previously treated)
- Skin cancers with poorly-defined borders
- Areas requiring maximum tissue preservation

**Fellowship Training:** Dr Harper completed advanced Mohs surgery fellowship training at Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane, one of only a handful of Mohs training centres in Australia. This subspecialist expertise ensures you receive world-class care from one of Sydney's most qualified Mohs surgeons.
